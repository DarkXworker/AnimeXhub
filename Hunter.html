    <div class="story">
      Gon Freecss, a spirited 12-year-old from Whale Island, discovers that his father Ging—whom he thought was dead—is alive and a legendary Hunter. Determined, Gon embarks on a journey to pass the grueling Hunter Exam, make powerful allies like Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio, and master the mystical Nen martial‑art system along the way. Their adventure thrusts them across lethal tournaments, crime‑ridden cities, and horrifying Chimera Ant threats—through every brutal battle and moral test, Gon grows into a hero worthy of his father’s legacy. From light-hearted beginnings to profound psychological depth, HXH blends strategy, emotion, and shocking twists in a masterpiece that evolves well beyond traditional shōnen storytelling.
